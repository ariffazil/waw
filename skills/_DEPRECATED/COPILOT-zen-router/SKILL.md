  META-MESA: Orthogonal skill taxonomy + intent→skill router for Copilot CLI.
  THE single skill that tells Copilot which domain skill to load based on task context.
  Load this FIRST when uncertain which skill to use. Covers all 147 federation skills
  organized into 9 orthogonal layers. DO NOT load domain skills blindly — route through this.

# 🎯 COPILOT ZEN ROUTER — The Meta-Mesa

> **DITEMPA BUKAN DIBERI** — One skill to route them all. The mesa above the terrain sees every path.

## How Copilot Uses This

When you receive a task, check this taxonomy. Each layer lists exact skill names — load ONLY the matching skill(s). Never load more than 5 domain skills at once. The 9 BOOTSTRAP skills are pre-loaded.

---

## L0 · BOOTSTRAP — Always Loaded (9 skills)

These fire at session start via `BOOTSTRAP_MANIFEST.json`. You already have them.

## ROUTING ALGORITHM — How to Select

```
1. Is this a BOOTSTRAP function? → Already loaded (L0)
2. Is this about constitutional floors/authority? → L1 GOVERNANCE
3. Is this about observing/searching/gathering? → L2 SENSE
4. Is this about reasoning/planning? → L3 THINK
5. Is this about executing/building? → L4 ACT (sub-route by domain)
6. Is this about sealing/vault/memory? → L5 SEAL
7. Is this about managing skills/self-improvement? → L6 META
8. Is this about a specific organ (GEOX/WEALTH/WELL)? → L7 DOMAIN
9. Is this a niche/specialized domain? → L9 SPECIALIZED
```

**ANTI-PATTERN: Load multiple FORGE skills for one task.** Pick the ONE most specific. Example:
- "deploy site" → ONLY `FORGE-agentic-web-builder` (not infra-guardian + vps-docker + cicd)
- "review PR" → ONLY `FORGE-pr-review` (not github-ops + precommit + code-review)

**PANIC RULE: Still unsure?** Load `AUDIT-skill-atlas` — it's the master skill inventory.

---

## Orthogonal Design Principles

1. **No overlap:** Each skill has one clear domain. If two skills trigger on the same phrase, merge them.
2. **Layered loading:** Bootstrap → Governance → Domain → Seal. Never skip layers on high-stakes work.
3. **Harness-aware:** Skills tagged `harness: copilot-cli` are native. Others may still work — test first.
4. **Minimal loading:** ≤5 domain skills per task. The agent is smart enough without overloading.
5. **Tool-first:** Many MCP tools (geox_*, capital_*, forge_*) need NO skill — just call them directly.

---

*DITEMPA BUKAN DIBERI — Forged 2026-07-28 for Copilot CLI as the single meta-mesa routing layer. This skill IS the orthogonal taxonomy. Load it whenever the task spans multiple domains or the right skill is unclear.*
